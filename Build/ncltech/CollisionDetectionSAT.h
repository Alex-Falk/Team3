/******************************************************************************
Class: CollisionDetectionSAT
Implements:
Author: 
	Pieran Marris <p.marris@newcastle.ac.uk> and YOU!
Description:

	This wrapper class is used to perform a Seperating Axis Therorem test between
	two convex collision shapes, firstly detecting if a collision occured and 
	then more throughly building a collision manifold if required.

	As part of Tutorial 4/5 we will be covering this in detail and building it 
	up ourselves. 

	The additional functionality provided here are geometric functions used in the 
	aforementioned tutorials to perform collision detection. I will try and detail
	them below:
		GetClosestPoint(<point> A, <edges>)
		 - Iterates through all edges returning the the point X which is the closest
		   point along any of the given edges to the provided point A as possible.
		   - Used in SAT detection phase

		PlaneEdgeIntersection(<plane>, <edge>[start, end])
		  - Performs a plane/edge collision test, if an intersection does occur then
			it will return the point on the line where it intersected the given plane.
			- Used in Sutherland-Hodgman Clipping (below)

		SutherlandHodgmanClipping(<mesh>, <clip_planes>)
		  - Performs sutherland hodgman clipping algorithm to clip the provided mesh
			or polygon in regards to each of the provided clipping planes. For more
			information see:
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland%E2%80%93Hodgman_algorithm
			 - Used to build collision manifold around instance and reference
			   faces.
