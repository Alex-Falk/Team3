Class: ScreenPicker
Implements:
Author:
Pieran Marris <p.marris@newcastle.ac.uk>
Description:
Uses picking as a means to allow mouse interactivity with world space objects.
Any renderable object can be clicked/hovered over etc and only requires registering/unregistering
itself to the Screen Picker instance when it wants to start/stop listening for mouse events.

This class works by rendering all objects in the scene to an off-screen texture, with
all clickable objects outputing their array index to the framebuffer. This is then sampled at
the mouse position and the relevent objects mouse functions are called. In order to get the
world space position of the mouse at a given location the depth buffer is also sampled and
multiplied by the inverse (projMtx*viewMtx) similar to how deferred rendering converts screen
space coordinates back into world space.

!!WARNING!!!
If you've reached this comment because you are stumbling through the headers trying desperately
to find out why the engine is so slow and the "Scene Updates" are apparently taking 3ms+ for a
simple scene and 0ms when clicking an object... then yes.. you have reached the source of the problem. =[

The method of reading pixels back from the graphics card is 'very' slow, as it requires the entire
rendering pipeline to stall while pixels are read back to the cpu. There are ways this can be optimized
by doing the reads asynchronously through the use of pixel buffers, however this wont aliaviate the big
issue - a whole extra render pass. As you progress through the physics module and hopefully implement a
broadphase you will find doing a ray cast through the broadphase a much faster means of doing
mouse-interactivity than screen picking and the way all professional game engines will handle it.

In the extra tutorials for Graphics for Games there is a tutorial on RayCasting for picking purposes,
which can be extended (with the new physics collision shapes) to provide an accurate picking solution.
