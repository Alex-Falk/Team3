Description:

	A manifold is the surface area of the collision between two objects, which 
	for the purpose of this physics engine is also used to solve all the contact
	constraints between the two colliding objects.

	This is done by applying a distance constraint at each of the corners of the manifold,
	constraining the shapes to seperate in the next frame. This is also coupled with
	additional constraints of friction and also elasticity in the form of a bias term to add
	additional energy to the system (elasticity) or negate existing velocity (friction).
