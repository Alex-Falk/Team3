Class: NetworkBase
Implements:
Author: Pieran Marris      <p.marris@newcastle.ac.uk> and YOU!
Description:
	A simple wrapper to encapsulate the core functionality provided by ENET library.

	In previous years, this would have been the class that handled all the sockets 
	directly. However, ENET can do this for us now.. so this wrapper class only really
	serves in keeping track of the network transfer rate in kilobits per second.

	ENET Overview
	----------------
	The ENET library is a nice low level library that sits directly on top of the sockets. 
	Automatically handling packet reliability, network throttling, packet splitting and
	other not so fun network tasks that previously made networking a pain to teach.

	The documentation is a little sparse, though in essecense each client will have it's own
	ENetHost object that manages all incoming and outgoing packets. An ENetHost can have one or
	more ENetPeer's connected at any given time which can communicated with via enet_peer_send(<packet with data>).

	The packets sent between clients can each optionally be sent via:
		- PACKET_TRANSPORT_UNRELABLE  (UDP)
		  These packets are a simple fire and forget. If they get lost over the network or dropped through throttling
		  we don't care. These are useful for time-sensitive data, which becomes obsolete after a given timeframe anyway.
		  In ENET this bypasses most of the library infrastructure and simply gets sent as a standard UDP datagram.

		- PACKET_TRANSPORT_RELIABLE  (~TCP)
		  These packets are tracked over the network with ACK's (acknowledgement identifier). Each packet to and from the peer's
		  will contain an additional ACK field informing the peer which packets it has previously recieved. If, after a given
		  timeframe, the peer has not recieved our packet (due to the ACK ID's not being contiguous) it will be re-sent.
		  This process continues until the peer acknoledges it has recieved our packet. This means we can make no assumptions
		  about when the packet will arrive, but we can assert that it /will/ arrive eventually. ENET accomplishes this by emulating
		  it's own variation of the TCP protocol on top of the existing UDP socket.
