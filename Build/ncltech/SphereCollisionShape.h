Class: SphereCollisionShape
Implements: CollisionShape

Description:

	Extends CollisionShape to represent a sphere.

	This is an example of a implicit collision shape, where all of the output data can be computed algorithmetrically. For instance,
	getting the closest point on a sphere only needs a radius to clamp the length of the vector. Implicit collision shapes are generally
	faster and more effecient, and allow the representation of perfect shapes that would require too many vertices/faces to represent otherwise
	e.g. curved surfaces.

	A sphere object is one of the easiest 3D shapes to model, as for collision purposes it can only ever have one axis of itersection,
	it also can only ever have one contact point. This makes alot of the returns quite trival compared to the cuboid that requires alot of
	setting up and adjanency information.
